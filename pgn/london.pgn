1.d4  { Begin of the London system. My notes playing as white.
Takes control of e5. Opens diagonal for B@c1. Keeps pawn defended by Queen. } c5  { Rare but aggressive response . Attacks d4. Gambits a pawn. Do not take dxc5. Black can respond e6, Bxc5 } ( 1...e6 2.Bf4 d5 ( 2...Nf6 3.e3 ) ( 2...c5 3.e3 ) 3.e3 Bd6 ( 3...c5 4.c3 ) ( 3...Nf6 4.Nf3 ) 4.Qg4  { Forcing either the King to move Kf8 or g6, weakening the black pawn structure } ) ( 1...Nf6  { Controls d5 and e4. Prepares for g6, Bg7. Blocks f pawn for black } 2.Bf4  { Accelerated London. Controls e5, centralizes Bishop. } g6  { Prepares for Bg7 } ( 2...e6  { Opens diagonals for queen and bishop } 3.e3 c5  { Attacks d4. Opens diagonal for queen. Is defended by bishop. } ( 3...d5  { Controls e4 } 4.Nf3  { Standard London stuff. } ) ( 3...b6  { Prepares Bb7?? } 4.Qf3  { Grabs the long diagonal. } ) 4.c3  { Defends d4. Opens diagonal for queen. Does not help to castle king side. } ) ( 2...c5  { Attacks d4. Opens diagonal for the queen } 3.d5  { Better win percentage than e3, but less often played. Investigate. } d6 ( 3...Qb6  { Threatens b2 } 4.Bc1  { Preferred by engine over Nc3, which loses a pawn, and b3 which weakens pawn structure } ) 4.Nc3  { Covers d5 and develops a piece. Slightly better than c4 } ) ( 2...d5  { Takes control of e4. Opens a diagonal for the bishop. } 3.e3  { Defends d4 ND F4. Opens diagonals for queen and bishop. } c5  { Attacks d4. Opens diagonal for queen } ( 3...Bf5 4.c4  { Not clear why this is so much better than Nf3. Investigate } ) ( 3...g6 4.Nf3  { Develops knight. Does not block bishop. } ) ( 3...e6  { Defends d5. Blocks black bishop. } 4.Nf3  { Develops knight. Does not block bishop. } ) 4.c3  { Adds one more defender to d4. Prevents b4 in the long run. (Better than dxc5, giving up control of the center) } ) 3.Nc3  { Confronts N@f6 over the e4 and d5 squares } d5  { Controls e4 } ( 3...Bg7  { Claims major diagonal. Ready to castle king side. } 4.e4  { Grabs more space... } ) 4.e3  { defends d4 and f4. Opens diagonal for queen and bishop. } ) ( 1...d5  { Controls e4. Queen defends pawn @d5. Opens diagonal for Bishop @c8. } 2.Bf4  { Doubles control of e5. Centralizes Bishop. } c5  { Attacks d4. Pawn is not defended. } ( 2...Nf6  { Defends d5, controls e4. Prepares  Bg7 } 3.e3  { Defends d4 and Bf4 } c5 ( 3...e6 4.Nf3 Bd6 ( 4...c5 5.c3 ) 5.Bg3 ) 4.c3 ) 3.e3  { Defends d4 and Bf4. Playing c3 here seems to be less well.  } Nc6 ( 3...cxd4 4.exd4 ) 4.c3 ) 2.d5 d6 ( 2...Nf6  { Attacks e4. Playing e4 is not an option. } 3.c4 ) ( 2...e5 3.e4 ) 3.e4
